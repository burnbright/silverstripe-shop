# Multi-Step Checkout

Historically the checkout has only been based on a single OrderForm. Whilst its nice to place an order
in a single form submission, in most cases different parts of the checkout process rely on the data
of others. In particular, to provide prices for shipping, we first need an address. To do this in a
single form, we require the aid of javascript/ajax.

There is a multi-step version of the checkout available that can be enabled. See shop/code/steppedcheckout,
which contains a number of decorators for CheckoutPage. Each step is stored in a class with an action
to view the step, a form to gather data, and an action to process the form data.

To enable the multi-step checkout:

 1. Add this to your _config.php file:
 
	SteppedCheckout::setupSteps();
	
The SteppedCheckout::setupSteps() function adds all of the steps as extensions to CheckoutPage_Controller,
and make sure the index action (yoursite.tld/checkout/) is the first step.
 
 2. Replace your CheckoutPage.ss template with one that uses steps. You can find such a template in
 shop/templates/Layout/SteppedCheckoutPage.ss you could put this in your mysite/templates/Layout folder
 and rename it to 'CheckoutPage.ss'.
 
You may notice that the SteppedCheckoutPage.ss template contains statements like:

	<% if IsFutureStep(contactdetails) %> ... <% end_if %>
	<% if IsCurrentStep(contactdetails) %> ... <% end_if %>
	<% if IsPastStep(contactdetails) %> ... <% end_if %>

These functions have been set up to enable a single page template to handle multiple actions. This approach
is good for showing upcoming steps, the current form, and past data that the user has entered already.

You can also define individual templates if you like, eg:

	mysite/templates/Layout/CheckoutPage_contactdetails.ss
	mysite/templates/Layout/CheckoutPage_shippingaddress.ss
	mysite/templates/Layout/CheckoutPage_billingaddress.ss
	mysite/templates/Layout/CheckoutPage_paymentmethod.ss
	mysite/templates/Layout/CheckoutPage_summary.ss
