# Shop Sub-Modules

This module has maintained a minimal core, but additional sub-modules have been created,
or will be created to augment the core system. Many features are not actually needed for a website,
so these have been kept seperate.

## Completed

 * [Discount Coupons](https://github.com/burnbright/silverstripe-shop-discount) - generate codes for customers to enter and recieve a discount on products, or the whole order.

## Ideas / TODO

 * Stock Control - keep track of stock numbers, warn when products are out of stock, or prevent sales.
 * Brand Browsing - browse products by brand
 * Choose What You Pay - a product that allows the user to choose what they will pay for it.
 * Digital Downloads / Virtual Products - products that are purely digital, only requiring download, and no shipping.
 * Financial Accounts - charge orders to a particular group/account, which could be in credit, or dept.
 * Google Analytics - integration to record shop sales to Google Analytics.
 * Sub Shops - allow members to create their own store, and sell products from.
 * Dontation - pay nothing or any price for something.
